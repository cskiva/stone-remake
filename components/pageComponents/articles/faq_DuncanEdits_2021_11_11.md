# General

## What is Stone?

Stone is a Windows 10 desktop application used to capture
and share knowledge. It facilitates the creation of a veritable
research record and engenders trust through its various
layers of provenance. By adopting Stone, journalists make
a commitment to greater transparency, which elevates
well-researched, high-quality reporting.

## Who uses Stone?

- Journalists

- Academics (Pedagogy)

- Computer Programmers

- Open Source Investigators

  This is not an exhaustive list. As we develop Stone, it will
  be applicable in a broader range of fields.

## On what operating system can I install Stone?

At this time, Stone works exclusively on Windows 10. The windows automatic updates should ensure you have the correct version.

Technical details: Minimum version 2004 (10.0.19041.0) with VC++ Redist 2019.

Stone will be installable on other operating systems in 2022.

## How do I download Stone?

Visit our webpage:
https://www.writeinstone.com/.

## Must I download Stone to capture and share research?

Yes.

## How do I create a Stone account?

When activating the software for the first time, select "create
new account" and input an email address and password.
Should you choose to, verify the account using a link sent to
the corresponding email address.

## How can I install Stone if I receive a Windows message that I have the "wrong version"?

Ensure that Windows 10 is fully updated.

## Is captured research secure on the Stone server?

Stone is in Beta, therefore it should only be used when
conducting research that can safely be shared publicly.
Research will not be sharable until published but we cannot
guarantee third parties will not be able to access material
stored on our servers. Stone's servers are based in Germany,
making us subject to GDPR compliance.

## Will Stone share personal data with third parties (specifically email addresses)?

No. We collect data on Stone software users and those who
interact with produced content. This data is
captured and stored in a manner which protects privacy
(IPs are hashed). In addition to pseudonymous data, Stone
retains a list of email addresses used to log-in to our system.
Our company maintains strict protocols for sharing this
information in-house and does not share email addresses with
third parties.

## Once Stone is installed, does it capture information when not activated by a user?

No. The screen capture function is activated only when a user selects
to do so.

## Can a Stone account be deleted?

Yes. Note that this cannot be done without the assistance
of a member of the WriteInStone team. Please contact us for
further information using the Contact Us feature in the desktop
client or by emailing info@writeinstone.com.

# Creating Content

## Must I create a video bio?

When using Stone for the first time, a user will be prompted
to create a video bio. A user can update their video bio from
the profile window on the desktop client.

## What are projects and to what do they correspond?

A project most often relates to a specific line of research and
comprises all research events. For instance, a journalist using
Stone would likely create a single project to capture research
pertaining to a specific story.

## What are desktop research sessions and how do they differ from projects?

A desktop session is a type of research event that utilizes
screen capture and webcam commentary to produce a record of
work done (on the computer desktop) and video annotations,
which are called "highlights".

## What are highlights and how are they added during a desktop session?

Highlights are webcam commentaries which users can
add at key points in the research process. Highlights are
added by clicking on the camera icon on the recording window
during a desktop research session.

## What is the retake function and how does it work?

When conducting a highlight, the retake function enables a
user to delete the ongoing highlight and begin another. This
function is activated by selecting the dumbslate
(clapperboard). The highlights which are "retaken"
will not appear in the embedded highlight reel, whereas the
highlight produced after the last retake will appear on the
reel.

## During a highlight, how many times can I “retake”?

There is no set limit on the number of times a user can select
"retake", though it is recommended that a user
limit their use of this function to ensure sound performance.

## What does the trash function do and how does it work?

When conducting a highlight, the trash function enables a user
to delete the ongoing highlight and return to work mode. This
function is activated by selecting the trash icon. The
"trashed" (deleted) highlight will not appear in the
embedded highlight reel.

## What does the crop function do and how does it work?

When selecting to highlight, the user has two choices:
standard highlight or cropped highlight. A cropped highlight
enables the user to focus on a selected section of the screen
and move the webcam image inside the selected area. All
other functions during a cropped highlight are the same as
in a standard highlight.

## Can the crop be reset once a portion of the screen is selected?

Yes, after selecting a portion of the screen to crop, the user
can press and hold the left-mouse button again to reset.

## What is external media and how is it added to a project?

External media comprise Mp3 and Mp4 files captured on external
devices such as a digital camera or phone. These can be
uploaded via the desktop client and will appear alongside
other research events in a project timeline.

## How are highlights added to external media?

Once external media has been uploaded via the desktop client,
select the event chip (thumbnail) corresponding to the external
media to be highlighted. Then select "add highlight".

## Can I create a research session without placing it in a project?

As currently constituted, Stone does not support this functionality.

## How do I delete a session?

Select the session for deletion from the timeline (specific
event chip [thumbnail]). Select the trash icon from within the
event chip and confirm the selection.

## A desktop session was ended erroneously. Is there a way to return to the session without having to start a new one?

Once the naming prompt window appears, select "back".

## How do I delete a project?

Select the project for deletion from the project list, which is
accessible via the "projects" drop down menu in the top left
corner of the desktop client. Then select the corresponding
trash icon on the right-hand side of the project list.

## How do I end a research session and start over?

Currently, there is no option to "redo" a session. Instead, a user must
select the event chip (thumbnail) corresponding to the desktop sesison,
delete it (as described above), and begin a new session.

## Will the webcam be activated every time I create a highlight?

The webcam will activate each time a highlight is initiated.

## How do I redact portions of desktop research?

Select the event chip corresponding to the desktop session
from which a portion of research is to be redacted.
Select "redact" and adjust the section highlighted in red.
Confirm the deletion.

NOTE: Redactions are permanent. Once sections of
an event are deleted, they cannot be recovered.

## Can I redact portions of an external media upload?

Yes. Use the same procedure as described for redacting
portions of desktop research sessions.

# Sharing Content

## What does “publish” do?

Publishing a project makes the materials contained within the
project (both desktop research and external media) publicly
accessible. Once published, the share menu will be accessible.

## Can stories be “unpublished”?

Yes. When on the editing page of the project to be
unpublished, select "unpublish" on the Projects dropdown menu.

## What is an embedded highlight reel?

Using whichever method is appropriate or preferred (URL or
HTML embed), a primary user can share research highlights in
an embedded player on CMS platforms. Select the share button
and copy either the URL or HTML code and paste into the
appropriate position.

## What is the public research page?

The public research page is a webpage on which media
consumers can review and scrutinize the full research record.

## What will play on a highlight reel if no highlights were made in any session of a project?

When no highlights have been produced in a published project,
the embedded highlight reel will exclusively display the
author's video bio.

## Can highlights be added to a desktop research session after it has been completed?

No. Desktop sessions can only be edited using the redact feature.

## How can readers access the full research record?

Either by clicking on the link at the bottom of the embedded
player or by clicking on a provided URL which links to the
public page.

## Once a project is updated, will added highlights play in the corresponding highlight reel and public research page?

Yes.

Unpublished additions to already published projects will not display
on the public research page and unpublished highlights will not
play in the embedded highlight reel.

## Once a project is updated, will deleted content be removed from the corresponding highlight reel and public research page?

Yes.

## If there is no playback on the highlight reel and/or the public research page, what steps should I take to ensure playback?

- Check that the project has been both published and updated.
- Reload the page on which the highlight reel is embedded or reload the public research page.
- If one is unable to initiate playback, use the Contact Us feature or email our team at [info@writeinstone.com](mailto:info@writeinstone.com) to offer feedback and request assistance.
